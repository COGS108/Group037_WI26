    "The interactive media known as video games emerged in the mid 20th century and expanded rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s with the massive rise of home consoles and personal computing. By the end of the 20th century, tens of thousands of video games have been released globally, and millions of video games sold worldwide. Video games are not just a source of entertainment, but they are also a medium which has significantly shaped culture, technological literacy and society. Iconic characters such as Mario, Pikachu, Sonic, and Steve have become globally recognized symbols, reflecting the widespread cultural influence of video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the critical success and acclaim of video games, their consumption worldwide has grown dramatically and continues to rise even today. Such consumption raises questions about the possible effects of video games, considering that it has become part of daily life for many individuals on a global scale. In Europe, accessibility to video games increased greatly throughout the 20th century, such that gaming became a common form of entertainment across different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. The widespread availability and impact of such forms of entertainment provide an opportunity to examine how varying levels of video game consumption correspond with educational performance indicators, such as literacy rates, standardized test scores, and broader academic achievement across European populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This growing interest in video games and its possible effects on education has prompted researchers and scholars. Previous studies have explored many distinct ways in which video games can affect an individual particularly when it comes to their education, including aspects of education such as learning, motivation, skill development and more. With this, and by situating it within the context of education in Europe, we can discover from previous work how historical patterns of video game consumption correspond with broader trends in academic achievement and literacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research has examined a possible relationship between video games and academic performance in the settings of education. Merino-Campos et al. (2023) identified that factors such as accessibility, enjoyment, and technological competence significantly influenced students’ acceptance of video games as learning tools, and that this acceptance was associated with improved academic performance in physical education contexts. This work suggests that video game engagement can have measurable educational effects, supporting further investigation into broader relationships between video game consumption and educational outcomes. <sup><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11295-y\">[1]</a></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies show that not only the relationship of learning tools with video games, but also the social and behavioral effects that come with such media. Squire (2003) observed in their research that while very often this form of media was ignored by educators, video games have become a relevant resource for the development and improvement of cultural competences, as well as  social and cognitive skills by secondary school students in the context of physical education. They draw on theories revolving around motivation, which they conclude that deeper learning and engagement can be produced by the key elements of video games such as the challenge, feedback, and other aspects. <sup><a href=\"https://boardwork317.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/video-games-in-education.pdf\">[2]</a></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, de Wit, Ferencz, and Rumbley (2018) focus their research on international mobility in Europe at a population level. They examine international mobility as a major indicator of educational strength, ability, accessibility, and quality across Europe. This research dates to the late 20th century, which was about the same period where video games rose in popularity and consumption. <sup><a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315160870-4/international-student-mobility-hans-de-wit-irina-ferencz-laura-rumbley\">[3]</a></sup>\n"

    "Hypothesis: Increased video game sales per capita in Europe is strongly associated with lower average PISA scores among the population within the 20th Century. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the background, because video games became the “new trend” in the twentieth century, countries were quick to adopt it; allowing games to become part of its culture and entertainment. More developed countries such as Europe were able to consume that at a much faster rate. During that same time period in Europe, there was also a decline in educational performance (PISA Scores) ranging from literacy score to test rates. We suggested that the rise of video games/video games sales is associated with lower educational performance since video games can have varying impacts on different people as it takes away time from studying and creates distractions. This does not explain a cause and effect relationship, rather an association based on observations which will be explored with supporting data. \n"

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall statement: This project is based on aggregated, publicly available databases and therefore does not contain any personally identifiable information (PII). However, it is possible that this data could be biased through collection biases resulting from differences in how consistently video game sales have been reported across countries and over time, especially in earlier time frames; additionally, the measures of educational performance are likely to be impacted by broader systemic factors that do not directly relate to video game consumption, such as the country’s overall economic development or its academic policies.\n",
    "To minimize these limitations, this project will not make any causal statements about the relationship between video games and educational outcomes. The project will state all limitations and will present the results using graphical representations and summary statistics that will allow for transparency and show the uncertainty within the data sets. Additionally, any observed correlations should not be interpreted as evidence of individual-level effects, and no policy recommendations can be made based on the observed correlations without additional supportive evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The video game market sales data and the education data may also be biased depending on the size of the gaming market in each country and how well those countries report their sales data. The education data may also have different quality and completeness across countries and years. This could potentially skew comparisons made.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While no individual-level data will be used in this project, there is always an ethical concern when analyzing large datasets, to some extent, because it is possible that unintentional personal information could be inferred by others. While the data is being reported at the country level, rather than the individual level, the potential for misuse or misinterpretation still exists.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is possible that the observed correlations could be misinterpreted as reflective of individual behavior or ability, and therefore, could potentially perpetuate negative stereotypes of youth or educational systems in certain countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Maintaining datasets past the time frame of the project will also provide a higher likelihood of reuse in ways that were not intended in the initial context (not likely though).\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because the analysis relies on aggregate national-level data, it will likely leave out the lived experiences of students, educators, and families, especially those from marginalized groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> These datasets used will likely not include additional confounders that may affect how one interprets the association between gaming and education (e.g., economic disparity, differing education policies, unequal access to technology)\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> There is also potential for representations of the trends to misrepresent trends or indicate causal relationships when they don't actually exist.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Although there is no personally identifiable information (PII) included in these datasets, aggregating data from many different sources can still create concerns for potential inference.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If analysis steps are not clearly documented or explained, errors or biased assumptions may remain uncorrected and continue to be replicated in subsequent analyses/interpretations of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> Statistical data can lead to incorrect interpretations of the impact that video games have on education when these findings are interpreted through a non-statistical view.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> The study's limitations may be misinterpreted as a result of failing to provide clear descriptions of the limitations of the research (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> Education performance is multifaceted, and using only a few metrics may make it difficult to capture all aspects of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "> We do not plan for the project to be continuously monitored after completion. We will take note of any feedback and criticisms received to identify possible misinterpretations of our results. Any errors found will be revised.\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "> Though it is not our intent, there is a possibility that certain groups or individuals may be misrepresented by our findings. If that is the case, we would like to clarify our project limitations and revise our conclusions to ensure no harm is caused. We emphasize that our project is an analysis and observation not meant to imply any causation.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "> If there are significant flaws or errors discovered in our data/results, we will withdraw the affected areas and replace them with corrected information and analysis.\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "> The goal of this project is to analyze correlations between datasets, and it is not meant to be used to form any concrete opinions against playing video games in regards to student education. We will ensure clarity in our project limitations and conclusions to ensure such cause-and-effect arguments are not derived as a result of our findings.\n"
